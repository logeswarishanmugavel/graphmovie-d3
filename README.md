Interactive GraphMovie tool using d3

Graph movie is an in-browser tool for viewing dynamically-changing graphs. The tool was used to debug the development of the research paper Incremental Computation with Names (OOPSLA 2015), and the workshop presentation Correct-by-construction Interactive Software. This project implements the GraphMovie tool using the [D3](https://d3js.org/) framework.
